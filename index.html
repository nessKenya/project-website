         <h2>Especially For Youth Africa</h2>
        <p>
            The objective of EFY is to strengthen youth in their commitment to live the gospel of Jesus Christ by providing inspiring and edifying learning opportunities and wholesome social experiences.

            In the mid-1970s, Ron Hills and other BYU employees developed a program to “create an Education Week for teenagers where youth could interact with other young people from various places in the country, rather than just with those from their own ward or stake.” That program was called Especially for Youth (EFY).

                So whatever He commands
                
                I will go and do
                I will stand for truth
                Though the world may back away
                I will walk right through
                I know if I follow Him
                Follow Him in faith
                He will ease my burdens

            <p>
                Darkness covered the earth.

                People were looking for truth,
                
                But it was taken away so long ago.
                
                God was preparing their hearts
                
                So He could light up the dark,
                
                ’Cause it was time for a new beginning.
                
                There was a boy who needed answers,
                
                One that was chosen by God.
                
                So He went and found a place to pray.

                When it’s bad weather 
                Sometimes I yell up at the sky 
                Today was supposed to be dry

             <h2>Youth Conferences</h2>
             <p>
                What is FSY?
                For the Strength of Youth (FSY) conferences are large conferences for youth held to help you apply the gospel in all aspects of your life. At FSY, you will participate in five days of devotionals, classes, and activities designed to build and strengthen your faith in Jesus Christ as you grow spiritually, socially, physically, and intellectually.
             </p>
             <p>
                FSY Conferences Postponed Until 2021
                Due to the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become necessary to postpone For the Strength of Youth (FSY) conferences scheduled to be held in the U.S. and Canada in 2020 until 2021. Youth from stakes invited in 2020 who still meet the age requirements will be invited to attend FSY in 2021 and registration details will be communicated at a later date.
